Have you ever wanted to make your coins more active and versitile to where you can have coin rates for each country to have a different coin? Or what about an active bank where you can take out loans with dynamic interest rates, and characters can store money and invest in businesses?

Here is every tool you could need for it! 

Version = Beta 1.0

I have finished all related alias' and subalias' for `!coins` to work! Please head over to this [github](https://github.com/Adalbar3333/Banks_Coins_and_Foreign_Exchange_Beta-1.0) and report any bugs, or features you would like to see!

Because of the nature of this alias, we will **NOT** be using the built-in command for coins `!game coins`.
